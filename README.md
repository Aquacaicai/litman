Literature Management System

## Install

We use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) to manage project dependencies. If you don't have uv installed, please follow the instructions on the [uv installation page](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Install dependencies:

```sh
uv sync
```

Enter uv venv:

```sh
uv venv
```

## Run

After entering uv venv, run

```sh
python main.py
```

Then open the URL bound to Flask, which is [http://127.0.0.1:2747](http://127.0.0.1:2747) by default.
